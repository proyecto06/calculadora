I have thoroughly searched all the provided files (index.html and all JavaScript files in the Scripts directory) for the label "Cargar Archivo de Dispositivos (Excel):" and any associated file input button. I was unable to find any instance of this text or a corresponding file upload element.

It is possible that:
1.  The element was present in a previous version of the code but has since been removed.
2.  The element is being dynamically generated by a script that uses a different string or method to create it, which my searches did not detect.

Therefore, I cannot remove the specified label and button as I cannot locate them in the current codebase. Please verify if the element still exists or if there's a different phrasing/location for it.
